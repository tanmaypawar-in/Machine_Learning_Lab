Practical Titles - <br>
Practical No.1 - Write a Program to find the mean, median, standard deviation and mode. 
using user defined functions. <br>
Practical No.2 - Create a data frame with columns at least 5 observations
a) Retrieve a particular column from the Data Frame
b) Summarize the data frame and observe the statistics of the Data Frame created
c) Observe the mean and standard deviation of the data frame and print the
values. <br>
Practical No.3 - Implementation of Linear Regression Using a CSV Dataset. <br>
Practical No.4 - Implementation of Non-Linear Regression Using a CSV Dataset. <br>
Practical No.5 - Write a program to implement the Logistic Regression for a sample training
data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier. <br>
Practical No.6 - Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample
training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier,
considering few test data sets. <br>
Practical No.7 - Write a program to implement k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to classify
the iris data set. <br>
Practical No.8 - Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3
algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply
this knowledge to classify a new sample. <br>
Practical No.9 - Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based
CART algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and
apply this knowledge to classify a new sample. <br>
